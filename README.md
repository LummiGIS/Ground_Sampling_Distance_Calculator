# Ground_Sampling_Distance_Calculator
GSD Calculator for different drone cameras


Given the camera CMOS sensor size in mm, the focal lenght of the camera in mm, the size of the resulting images in pixels, and the height above ground in meters this script will calculate the spatial resolution (or ground sampling distance) in centimeters, and the image footprint (assumed to be a flat ground plane) in meters.
